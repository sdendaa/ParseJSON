#PROGRAM - PARSER

Write a program in JAVA that will take a file name as input and read that data file expecting the fixed width layout given below, and attempt to serialize each line into a JSON object. A sample of data file has been provided in the current directory but program should work with any any text file in the data layout provided below. Feel free to commit your test data files to impress us.

#DATA LAYOUT
Column 1 to 20 - NAME in the format "Last Name, First Name Middle Name". Other variations may be possible such as there is no comma or even no spaces between the name components. Make assumptions which ever scenarios you decide to address. 

Column 21 to 28 - Date of Birth in the format MMDDYYYY. Make assumptions for invalid formats if they come in.

Column 29 to 37 -  Social Security Number

#LOST?
Make as many assumptions as you would like, make a note of those either in the code or readme file.
